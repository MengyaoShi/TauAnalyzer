# TauAnalyzer
This is a repository under development, the key idea is, at early stage(first year) of our research, we know limited information about our 
signal background properties. It's more exploratory than getting 100 plots at a time. I'm developing this "Analyzer collection" aiming
to maximize our efficiency in getting most of information from all skimmed dataset/background. Ideally you should run one single script, 
and get all the plots we want so far. It's aiming for writing a full analysis note.

The first function of this analyzer collection now is to get signal/background overlaid plot. But difference is it has a much better
structure, and can be used on data. We can specify region we want to blind, and can analyze background/signal in one single run.

However it's under developing now. But should become more and more powerful with time.
